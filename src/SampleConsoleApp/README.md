# Sample
This sample serves as an example of how to use the ResourceHealthChecker.

It uses both a config file as well as code to create several checkers.  

You will need to either replace the connection strings / create the folders in order for the samples to work.  You also need to ensure you change the IsEnabled status to True in order to run the samples.
